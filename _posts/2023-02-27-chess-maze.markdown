Last week we discussed an advanced chess variant called [Retrograde Analysis]({% post_url 2023-02-19-retrograde-analysis %}). It can be quite challenging to play chess backwards!

But some chess variants can be quite pleasant and simple. Take for example chess mazes as described in this [website](https://www.danheisman.com/chess-exercises.html). The goal in the examples below is for the Knight to capture the black King. You are only to move Knight. The goal is to find a series of consecutive moves that result in the black King being capture. Go ahead and give it a try. They get progressively more challenging.
