This was Waimea Chess Club's second open house. And what a great open house it was!

Some folks played "The Farmer and the Piggies" mini-game from the [first open house]({% post_url 2022-12-01-first-open-house %}). Others played a new mini-game called "Pawn Wars".

These mini-games are great when getting started in chess but are also challenging for experienced players. We of course had many classical games going on as well. All in all, a very energetic and fun open house. Thank you to everyone who participated!

Also, a special shout out to Uncle Pete for giving us the beautiful space and chess sets and everything we need to get going. Mahalo Uncle Pete!

We'll have another chess open house next week. Come join us!
