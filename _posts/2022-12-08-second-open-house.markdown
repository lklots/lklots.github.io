This was Waimea Chess Club's second open house. And what a great open house it was!

Auntie Shelley, ever the community organizer, invited so many folks to come over and boy did they show up. In attendance we had Reef, Roots and their father Tobe, Kaila and KK and their mom Megan, Jonny and his mom Hillary, Ona and her mom Sophia, Mana, Jotan and their mom Diana and Eli and his mom Shelley.

Some folks played "The Farmer and the Piggies" mini-game from the [first open house]({% post_url 2022-12-01-first-open-house %}). Others played a new mini-game called "Pawn Wars".

And of course all this would not have been possible without Uncle Pete who prepared and renovated the space and got us all the chess stuffs. Mahalo uncle Pete!

We'll have another chess open house next week. Come join us!
